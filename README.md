welcome to my game! My name is Hua Zhao. In the game, you are allow to control the ball move around the 'world'. Your job is to push the crate to the ground in order to get scores. 
You will have 3 mins to finish the job. If you haven't push all the crates to the ground, you will lose. Enjoy the game!
